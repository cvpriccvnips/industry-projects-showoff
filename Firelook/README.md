# Firelook
a LBS based Android App for users to post and search nearby events

1. Developed an Android App for users to post events and search nearby events based on keyword hashtags with Java, Android Studio and Google Firebase
2. Utilized Firebase realtime database and storage to store and manage user-created content including event titles, messages, locations and images
3. Integrated Google Map API for a quick display of nearby events and navigation to user selected location
4. Integrated Google AdMob for in-app advertising to improve user experience
5. Used Firebase Cloud Function (FCF) to subscribe to new post and send notification via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to app users
